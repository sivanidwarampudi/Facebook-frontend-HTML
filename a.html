 	<p> “Dummy schools are coaching centres that tie-up with regular schools to reduce the school workload on students, thus allowing them more time to focus on their entrance exam preparation. This concept is most popular for the two major entrance exams for science students – JEE and NEET. <abbr title="World Health Organsiation">WHO</abbr></strong></p>

<strong>Students in dummy schools have about two classes a day that lasts for approximately one to one and a half hour each day, which mainly focus on board exams and school syllabus.</strong><i>The rest of the day is spent focusing on entrance exam preparation at the coaching centre, for which the classes typically go on for 8-9 hours. In contrast to this</i>, a student from a regular school spends about 7 hours a day in school attending classes for different subjects and engages in extra-curricular activities. Besides this, in a regular school, it is mandatory for students to have a minimum of 75% attendance, failing which students are not allowed to writeen.
